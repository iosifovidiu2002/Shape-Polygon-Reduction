# Shape-Polygon-Reduction
Using the Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm for curve decimation to reduce shapes drawn Paint-like to a minimum edge polygon.

## After the algorithm is applied, the set of points that defines the drawing is reduced to a much smaller ordered set representing the reduced polygon shape.
